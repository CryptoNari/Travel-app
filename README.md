# Capstone - Travel Planner App

Final Project on the "Udacity - Front End Web Developer nanodegree" course.

## Overview:

This project requires to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

## Project Specifications

The Project specifications to pass can be looked up in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2669/view).

### Extend Options

At least one of these is required, but the rest are great additional ways to further customize and improve your project!

- [x] Add end date and display length of trip.
- [x] Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
- [] - Allow user to add multiple destinations on the same trip.
       -Pull in weather for additional locations.
- [] - Allow the user to add hotel and/or flight data.
       - Multiple places to stay? Multiple flights?
- [] Integrate the REST Countries API to pull in data for the country being visited.
- [] Allow the user to remove the trip.
- [] Use Local Storage to save the data so that when they close, then revisit the page, their information is still there.
- [] Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
- [] Incorporate icons into forecast.
- [] Allow user to Print their trip and/or export to PDF.
- [] Allow the user to add a todo list and/or packing list for their trip.
- [] - Allow the user to add additional trips (this may take some heavy reworking, but is worth the challenge).
       - Automatically sort additional trips by countdown.
       - Move expired trips to bottom/have their style change so it’s clear it’s expired.
